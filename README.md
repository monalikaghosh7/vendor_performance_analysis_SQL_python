## Overview
This project evaluates **vendor performance** and **retail inventory dynamics** to drive insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization.  
A complete analysis pipeline was built using:
- **SQL** for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (ETL)  
- **Python** for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical testing  

---

## Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management are critical in retail.  
This analysis aims to:
- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments  
- Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits  
- Analyze cost-benefit of bulk purchasing  
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies  
- Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability  

---

## Dataset
- Multiple CSV files located in `/data/` folder: **sales**, **vendors**, and **inventory** data  
- Summary tables generated during the cleaning & processing stage for analysis  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** â€“ CTEs, joins, aggregations, and filtering  
- **Python** â€“ Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy  
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control and documentation

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed transactions with:
  - Gross Profit â‰¤ 0  
  - Profit Margin â‰¤ 0  
  - Sales Quantity = 0  
- Created vendor-level summary metrics  
- Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Negative or Zero Values Detected:**
- Gross Profit: min `-52,002.78` (loss-making sales)  
- Profit Margin: min `-âˆž` (sales at/below cost)  
- Unsold inventory: slow-moving stock  

**Outliers Identified:**
- Freight costs up to `257K`  
- Large purchase/actual prices  

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Weak: Purchase Price â†” Profit  
- Strong: Purchase Qty â†” Sales Qty (`0.999`)  
- Negative: Profit Margin â†” Sales Price (`-0.179`)  

---

## Research Questions & Key Findings
- **Brands for Promotions:** 198 brands with low sales but high profit margins  
- **Top Vendors:** Top 10 vendors = 65.69% of purchases â†’ over-reliance risk  
- **Bulk Purchasing Impact:** 72% cost savings per unit in large orders  
- **Inventory Turnover:** $2.71M worth of unsold inventory  
- **Vendor Profitability:**  
  - High Vendors: Mean Margin = 31.17%  
  - Low Vendors: Mean Margin = 41.55%  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistically significant difference in profit margins â†’ distinct vendor strategies

## How to Run This Project
1. Load CSVs into the database by running [`ingestion_db-checkpoint.py`](./ingestion_db-checkpoint.py)

2. Generate vendor summary using [`get_vendor_summary-checkpoint.py`](./get_vendor_summary-checkpoint.py)

3. Run the notebooks:
   [Exploratory Data Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb)  
   [Vendor Performance Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb](./Vendor%20Performance%20Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb)



## Final Recommendations

- Diversify vendor base to reduce risk  
- Optimize bulk order strategies  
- Reprice slow-moving, high-margin brands  
- Clear unsold inventory strategically  
- Boost marketing for underperforming vendors
